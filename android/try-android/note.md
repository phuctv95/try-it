## Basic

Basic:
- `MainActivity.kt` is the entry point for your app.
- `activity_main` defines the UI.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` describes the fundamental characteristics of the app.
- `build.gradle` (one for app, one for project): controls how the Gradle plugin builds your app.

UI:
- The user interface (UI) for an Android app is built as a hierarchy of *layouts* and *widgets*.
